# All session-wide env is now handled by UWSM:
#   - ~/.config/uwsm/env            (global for every uwsm session)
#   - ~/.config/uwsm/env-hyprland   (Hyprland-only)
#
# Keep this file for legacy include ordering. If you truly need a var that must
# be set via Hyprland's parser (rare with uwsm), uncomment and add it below
# using the exact syntax:  env = KEY,VALUE  (no quotes)
#
# Example (usually not required under uwsm):
# env = QT_WAYLAND_DISABLE_WINDOWDECORATION,1
